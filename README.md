Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, these drivers will help you save time and effort in writing low-level code, allowing you to focus on your project's main logic.

## Features

- Peripheral-specific drivers for various modules:
  - GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
  - UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
  - ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
  - Timer/Counter
  - PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
  - I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
  - SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
  - and more!

- Easy-to-use APIs: The drivers are designed with simplicity and readability in mind, making them beginner-friendly and accessible to everyone.

- Well-documented: Each driver comes with detailed documentation and usage examples, helping you quickly understand how to integrate them into your project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the drivers in this repository, ensure you have the following:

- Atmega16 microcontroller board or an Atmega16 simulator.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with AVR-GCC toolchain installed.
- Appropriate hardware connections as per your application requirements.

### Installation

To start using the Atmega16 drivers in your project, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project's root directory.
3. Use the following command to clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mahmoudisma3il18/Atmega16_Drivers.git
   ```

## Usage

1. Include the required driver's header file in your source file, for example:

   ```c
   #include "gpio.h"
   ```

2. Follow the documentation and usage examples for each driver available in the "docs" directory.

3. Implement the driver APIs in your code to interact with the specific peripherals.

4. Build and upload your code to the Atmega16 microcontroller.

For detailed information on how to use each driver, refer to the documentation provided in the "docs" folder.
